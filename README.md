<h1>Discord Bot using Python</h1>
<h2>ðŸš€ How it works:</h2>
<p>You add the bot to a given server/guild and give it the necessary permissions.</p>
<p>Next, on your discord server, type <code>!help</code> to see all the commands available on the bot.</p>
<hr>
<h3>ðŸŽµ Music System</h3>
<p>The bot comes equiped with a built-in music system in which you listen to your favorite song while on a voice channel with your friends. The commands are:</p>

```
!play 'link of the song on youtube'
```
<p>Or, if you don't have Youtube open, you can just type the name of the song and the bot will automatically search it up on Youtube and play the first result. Example:</p>

```
!play bohemian rhapsody
```

<p>Another important command is the <code>!queue</code> command, which allows the user to play one song after another, without having to use the <code>!play</code> command everytime they want to listen to a new song.</p>

```
!queue 'link of the song on youtube'
!queue 'name of the song'
```

<p>The other commands are the following:</p>

```
!clear-queue
!pause
!resume
!stop
```

<h2>ðŸ’»Libraries used:</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>Discord.py</li>
      <li>Yt_dlp (used to download audio and video from many websites)</li>
      <li>Sqlite3 for database.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>ðŸ‘¾ About the project:</h2>
<p>I've been using discord for a long time now, and I always wondered how those fancy bots were made, so I decided to challenge myself and make one of my own to test my coding abilities.
I consider this an intermediate level coding project and I plan on adding features to this bot in the near future in order to make it a complete and scalabe bot that other users can add to their own servers and enjoy its tools.</p>
